# MAS-Monika-Expanded


A submod designed to evolve Monika’s sentience, giving her new environments, behaviours, and dialogue that reflect a world—and a love—that grows with you.

This submod is still in-progress. I've taken the liberties of attaching the planned (and actively worked on) features of MAS: Monika Expanded.

* = important note that I recommend reading to lower the risks of game-breaking experiences.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A short summary of what's included in this submod:**



- 6 new locations with interactive dialogue
- Expanded gifting system with hidden reactions
- New CGs, outfits, and pose sprites
- Custom calendar events
- Horror elements and lore expansion
- Optional idle mode and activity cycling

------------------------------------------------------

**Elaboration on the core features of this submod:**



1. Explorable Locations

Ever wanted to physically leave the Classroom with Monika and have her enter new environments such as:

- A forest
- A café
- A library
- Her very own room (wow. amazing. she has a bedroom now!!! you get to watch her sleep!!!)
- A kitchen (she needs more hobbies)
- A bathroom (?)

Well, now you can! With six new locations you never asked for and the "Leave the Classroom" button, you can now spend even more time with Monika as she cycles through brand new sprites, dialogue and interactive menus! Maybe you'll even be able to pat her head if you ask nicely enough?
   
2. Poetry System

She'll occasionally gift you new poems depending on the date, relationship milestones, previous conversations and holidays. Try not to delete them, or else you risk facing penalities like losing over -50 affection.
   
3. Expanded Dialogue*

Monika’s conversations evolve based on location, time, and prior events.

For example, if she ends up finding an interesting plant or -knife- in the forest, there's a chance that she'll reference it later in the classroom.

She'll ask you questions about yourself and remember them for future use. Your answers are manually written by you and can be modifed anytime.

Certain dialogues (including the expanded gifting section) come with a set of randomized lines for her to cycle through to keep things fresh.

4. Cutscenes, CGs and Outfits

Since DDLC was originally built on a visual novel engine, I think it's reasonable to expect that those design elements make a more frequent appearance in MAS. Both old and new locations will have its own set of obtainable cutscenes, CGs and outfits to view as your relationship with Monika progresses. This includes new unlockable outfits that shouldn't need to be gifted to be used by her.

There will also be specialized greetings such as: finding Monika asleep at her desk, catching Monika in the middle of writing a poem and an uninvited guest(s) sitting at Monika's desk.

5. Expanded Gifting Options (with easter eggs)

New gifting categories such as "Trinkets," "Food," and "Beverage" have been created with more items that can be gifted to Monika. Occasionally, she will request an item without being prompted by you, the player. 

Certain items will lead to unlocking a new feature, location or hidden events. For example:

- marriagecertificate.gift
- portraitofmarkov.gift
- bathroomkey.gift
- journal.gift
- edibleshovel.gift

Monika will slowly reveal every new possible gift with time and a record will be kept in her journal (after you gift it to her).
 
6. More Mini-games*

Extra games that are meant to increase interactivity while simultaneously unlocking new dialogues with Monika. Titles TBD. Tetris is an option.

7. Even More Horror Elements

Keeping it true to DDLC's roots -- a psychological thriller game disguised as a cute dating simulator. 

8. Custom Databases

All new content is stored in separate databases to preserve MAS’s core integrity and ensure compatibility. Certain in-game core features run the risk of being modified to declutter the current UI and reduce lag, like the Talk Menu.

9. Idle Mode and Activity Cycling*

Monika no longer stares blankly while you play—she writes, talks to herself, or cycles through poses. (Look at pose sprite expansion for more details)

10. Pose Sprite Expansion*

New classroom poses with optional auto-switching behavior. Vanilla game outfits will be compatible with these new sprites, alongside the new unlockable outfits this submod adds to the game.

11. Custom Calendar Events

Whether it's a custom reminder, a holiday and other, you can add it to the Calendar in her classroom! The Calendar won't be present in outdoor locations in this submod, but you'll find variations of it in the kitchen, her room and the bathroom.

**IMPORTANT NOTES TO AVOID BREAKING YOUR GAME**


*Expanded Dialogue : It's recommended that you set your frequency of random chatter to "Occasionally" to avoid being spammed by Monika. She'll even offer to do it for you for convenience's sake. 

*Minigames : Minigames are the lowest priority right now. They might even be scrapped altogether depending on how the development of this submod goes.

*Idle mode/activity cycling and pose sprite expansion : Certain dialogue options will be unavailable if this feature is disabled to prevent bugs. If Monika is wearing an outfit that is compatible with this feature, then you'll be fine. Otherwise, you run the risk of having Monika automatically swapping from the outfit you've chosen, to reverting to her default mode.
