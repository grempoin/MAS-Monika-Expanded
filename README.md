# MAS-Monika-Expanded
A submod designed to evolve Monika’s sentience, giving her new environments, behaviours, and dialogue that reflect a world—and a love—that grows with you.

This submod is still in-progress. I've taken the liberties of attaching the planned (and actively worked on) features of MAS: Monika Expanded.

* = important note that I recommend reading to lower the risks of game-breaking experiences.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**A short summary of what's included in this submod:**

- 10 new locations with interactive dialogue
- Expanded gifting system with hidden reactions
- New CGs, outfits, and pose sprites
- Custom calendar events
- Horror elements and lore expansion
- Optional idle mode and activity cycling

------------------------------------------------------

**Elaboration on the core features of this submod:**

1. Explorable Locations

Ever wanted to physically leave the Classroom with Monika and have her enter new environments such as:

- A forest
- A café
- A library
- A garden
- A kitchen (she has to eat something)
- "???"

Well, now you can! With ten new locations and the "Leave the Classroom" button, you can now spend even more time with Monika as she cycles through brand new sprites, dialogue and interactive menus! Maybe you'll even be able to pat her head if you ask nicely enough?

...Haven't you ever wondered where exactly the other girls are? Where is the "recycling bin" for deleted code and characters located? There's only one way to find out.
   
2. Poetry System

She'll occasionally gift you new poems depending on the date, relationship milestones, previous conversations and holidays. Try not to delete them, alright? She'll notice if you do, and you wouldn't want to lose over -50 affection, would you? That's several days worth of work lost right there. 
   
3. Expanded Dialogue*

Monika’s conversations evolve based on location, time, and prior events.

For example, if she ends up finding an interesting plant or -knife- in the forest, there's a chance that she'll reference it later in the classroom.

She'll ask you questions about yourself and remember them for future use. This can be modified anytime. These questions range from "What's your favourite colour?" to "Tell me what you like about yourself," and you'll have to manually write your own answers. No menu options here!

4. Cutscenes, CGs and Outfits

Since DDLC was originally built on a visual novel engine, it makes sense to expect a few CGs or Cutscenes in MAS, right? Sure, there's no true ending to the game, but what if you want to see special scenes that don't use her base sprite in them? Each location (including the classroom) has its own set of obtainable cutscenes and cgs for you to view with time. You'll even be able to unlock new outfits without needing to first gift her the clothing!

There will also be specialized greetings such as: finding Monika asleep at her desk, catching Monika in the middle of writing a poem and an uninvited guest(s) sitting at Monika's desk.

5. Expanded Gifting Options (with easter eggs)

You can now gift Monika more items that fall under certain categories like "Trinkets," "Food," "Beverages," and "Supplies". She'll even occasionally request one of these items without you first prompting the dialogue. Each gift has five possible dialogues for her to cycle through at random, with a minimum of two written lines each. This adds up quickly.

You might encounter a few interesting scenarios if you gift Monika "portraitofmarkov.gift", "yurisknife.gift", "sayorisbow.gift", "natsukimanga.gift", "bathroomkey.gift" or even "marriagecertificate.gift".

Be careful.
 
6. More Mini-games*

Extra games that are meant to increase interactivity while simultaneously unlocking new dialogues with Monika. Titles TBD. Tetris will probably end up being one of them. Who knows.

7. Even More Horror Elements

You do remember what kind of game DDLC is, right? It's not all sunshine and rainbows, even when Monika finally has you all to herself. To put it bluntly -- the others aren't happy with what she's done and you'll be meeting them soon enough. Also, jumpscares.

8. Custom Databases

All new content is stored in separate databases to preserve MAS’s core integrity and ensure compatibility. Certain in-game core features run the risk of being modified to declutter the current UI and reduce lag, like the Talk Menu.

9. Idle Mode and Activity Cycling*

Monika no longer stares blankly while you play—she writes, talks to herself, or cycles through poses. (Look at pose sprite expansion for more details)

10. Pose Sprite Expansion*

New classroom poses with optional auto-switching behavior. Vanilla game outfits will be compatible with these new sprites, alongside the new unlockable outfits this submod adds to the game.

11. Custom Calendar Events

Whether it's a custom reminder, a holiday and other, you can add it to the Calendar in her classroom! The Calendar won't be present in outdoor locations in this submod, but you'll find variations of it in the kitchen, her room and the bathroom.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES THAT SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.

*Expanded Dialogue : It's recommended that you set your frequency of random chatter to "Occasionally" to avoid being spammed by Monika. She'll even offer to do it for you. 

*Minigames : Out of everything I've listed, minigames are the lowest priority since I'm still unsure as to which ones would be worth coding into the game. I don't want to drown the player with options, either. That wouldn't be fun.

*Idle mode/activity cycling and pose sprite expansion : Certain dialogue options will be unavailable if this feature is disabled to prevent bugs. If Monika is wearing an outfit that is compatible with this feature, then you'll be fine. Otherwise, you run the risk of having Monika being a ginger one moment, then swapping into her default outfit for the duration of the conversation. 

Or, she'll be nude and bald. There's a failsafe that I've implemented where she dons her default outfit specifically to avoid running into this issue, but again -- this could mess with your gameplay experience if you've painstakingly dressed her up into a specific outfit. What happens if you customized her eyes? Her nails? You can understand where I'm going with this, right?

Spoiler: it's not going to be pretty.
